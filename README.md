# ibmcloud-signup Register for IBM Cloud account
Instructions for getting an IBM Cloud account, and applying promotion code


Each registrant for the Llods Banking Group Hackathon will receive an email invitation to sign up for an IBM Cloud Lite account, and to apply a promotion code to that account to open up a broader range of services and capacity.

The promo code needs to be applied to through the IBM Cloud account billing menu, once the account is established, and the user has logged in for the first time.

*Each user must apply their own, individual promotion code to their account*

Within the invitation will be a URL of the form https://ibm.biz/ABABABA - the invitee should click the link, which will take them to an IBM Cloud registration page.

From there, follow the instructions at [IBM's Cognitive Class registration site](https://cognitiveclass.ai/applying-ibm-cloud-promo-code/) to activate the promo code.

The most significant effects of adding the promo code will be:
+ raising the runtime memory limit from 256MB to 8GB
+ allowing the use of services which offer free plans, or free tiers (as distinct from Lite plans)
+ allowing multiple instances of services on with a Lite Plan 

Before the end of the promo code period (~ 180 days from activation), the account will need attention - one of:
+ allow to lapse, and be locked out
+ add credit card details to keep the account active -- free and lite usage satys free, but other services/usage becomes billable
+ adopt the account into an enterprise subscription
